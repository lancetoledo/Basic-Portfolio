                    <p>I am obssessed with learning. My dad told me when I was 6 I would open and close the fridge door just because I wanted to learn how it worked. As I got a little older, my curiousity lead to video games and I ended up modding titles like "Super Smash Bros Brawl" and "Minecraft". Eventually I wanted to explorer the possibilties of being a developer and I fell in love with coding.</p>

                    <p>My love for learning has also lead me to learn various hobbies such as, Photography, Video Editing, Guitar, and even Dance!</p>
